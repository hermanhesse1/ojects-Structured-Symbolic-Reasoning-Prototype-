# ojects-Structured-Symbolic-Reasoning-Prototype:
foundational approach to integrating Haskell for core symbolic logic processing with Python for high-level orchestration and data pipelining. It features a simple Haskell module compiled into a shared library, callable from Python using ctypes via a Foreign Function Interface. 
The current example showcases a basic "inference" task (counting positive integers) to illustrate the FFI setup, project structure, and potential for building more complex symbolic reasoning engines. It serves as a template for leveraging Haskell's strong typing and functional paradigms for logic components within a Python ecosystem.
The code involves the following: Haskell core logic module.
FFI export for C-compatible function calls.
Python ctypes interface for loading and calling Haskell functions.
Example data pipeline and benchmarking in Python.
Makefile for easy compilation of the Haskell shared library.
Unit tests for the FFI bridge.
